Since then, she’s become an acclaimed presence in the hair care industry and an in-demand celebrity stylist, specializing in hair for women of multi-cultural ethnicities.  
The natural exuberance and talent Kim brings to her clients and to her brand can be seen in numerous magazines, including Vanity Fair, Allure and Vogue, along with feature films and television shows.  Kim’s work has been showcased in national campaigns such as Pepsi, Neutrogena, Nike, Cover Girl and Beyoncé’s award-winning project “Lemonade.”

Blige, and Oprah Winfrey among others.

<i>Hair care is an overall term for parts of hygiene and cosmetology involving the hair on the human head. Hair care will differ according to one's hair type and according to various processes that can be applied to hair. 'Hair care' is taken to mean care of hair on the human head, but mention should be made of process and services which impact hair on other parts of the body.These services are offered in our HAIRCARE.</br></br>

Use of lemon, chamomile tea or honey as they work as great hair lighteners. We can add lemon juice to water and spray it over your hair when we're heading out. We can rinse our hair with brewed chamomile tea after we wash them with shampoo or add honey to the water we use to wash your hair.</br></br>

“Using the wrong hair products for our hair texture could cause breakage,” says Kingsley. That might include a no- or low-poo shampoo, or another often irritating product: styling products. “Use of hair gels, pomades, and dry shampoos can accumulate on the scalp, causing inflammation that prevents hair from growing as well as it normally can,” Zeichner says.</br></br>

<h3 style="color:brown"><u><b><i>Importance of HAIRCARE</i></b></u></h3>
<p><i>
* Brush our hair before shampooing to eliminate the tangles.</br>
* Brushing is less damaging than combing but a long brushing can also damage the hair.</br>
* Back combing is also harmful for the hair.</br>
* Always use a good comb if we feel more comfortable in combing.</br>
* Nylon brushes with pointed ends also break the hair.
